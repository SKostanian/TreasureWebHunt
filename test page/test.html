        <p><b>Outcome</b>: The game showed us the full potential of our app, how it shows the different buttons on the different questions,
        required to have integer, string or boolean answers.</p>
        <p><b>Total Impression</b>: we had an amazing time evaluating our own developed game!</p>

        <p><b>Participants</b>: Team member relative</p>
        <p><b>Purpose</b>: To find how our game is playable and give us the response on the design and functionality</p>
        <p><b>Outcome</b>:The relative really liked the design, button animations and the ability to install the web application on a device.
            P.s: I was really proud of it :) (One of our teammates)</p>
